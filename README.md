# ⚓️ Privateerr ☠️🏴‍☠️

Ahoy there! Welcome to Privateerr, where we sail the digital seas with Private Internet Access and WireGuard!

## 🦜 Captain's Log ⚓️

Privateerr be a Docker Compose setup designed to build PIA manual connection scripts into a Docker image with the necessary WireGuard tools, generating a configuration file for native WireGuard connections. This setup ensures ye have a secure VPN connection as ye navigate the digital seas.

> [!NOTE]
> 🏴‍☠️ This here be fer seasoned pirates wantin' to automate PIA and WireGuard with Docker! New deckhands might want to learn the ropes first.

The main configuration lives in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file. This file handles building the image based on Ubuntu Focal, using the [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) found in the `docker` directory. The Docker Compose setup can be customized by copyin' the [example.env](./example.env) file to `.env` and adjustin' it to suit yer needs.

Included in this repo is the [PIA manual-connections](https://github.com/pia-foss/manual-connections) repository as a submodule at `docker/pia`, so it's part of the image build. Once the build is complete, ye can use the generated WireGuard configuration file at [`config/wg0.conf`](config/wg0.conf) to set up a VPN client like Gluetun.

Set sail with Privateerr, and enjoy secure connections across the seven seas! 🌊🏴‍☠️

## 🗺️ Chartin' Yer Course 🔧

To set sail and embark on yer VPN journey, follow these steps:

```bash
# Hoist the Jolly Roger and clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:scottgigawatt/privateerr.git
cd privateerr

# Copy the example environment file
cp example.env .env

# Open .env file and adjust the values to yer requirements

# Weigh anchor and start the container
make
```

> [!TIP]
> 🦜 Pro tip: Adjust yer `.env` like a savvy navigator before hoisting anchor.

The treasure map to yer WireGuard configuration file will be buried in the [`config`](./config/) directory. This directory contains a default configuration file, [`wg0.conf`](./config/wg0.conf).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚓️ Yer precious `wg0.conf` be the map to yer VPN treasure—keep it safe or risk scurvy.

When ye run Privateerr, this file will be updated with the PIA WireGuard configuration. Ye can then use this configuration file to configure a VPN client like Gluetun for secure connections.

## ☠️ Navigatin' Troubled Waters 🌊

> [!WARNING]
> ☠️ One wrong command an' ye could sink the whole ship! Mind yer `make` targets, matey.

The included `Makefile` be yer trusty map to help ye navigate these treacherous waters. Use these commands to steer yer ship with ease and gain a clearer view of the environment and configuration details. Set sail with confidence, ye scurvy dogs! 🏴‍☠️

```console
❯ make help
Usage: make [TARGET]

Targets:
  all             - Builds and starts the service stack.
  build-depends   - Ensures build dependencies are installed.
  pia-creds       - Ensures Private Internet Access credentials are set.
  down            - Stops and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images.
  clean           - Alias for down.
  build           - Builds the service stack.
  up              - Builds, (re)creates, and starts containers for services.
  run             - Alias for up.
  logs            - Shows logs for the service.
  help            - Displays this help message.
```

## 🏝️ Know Yer Waters 🔍

> [!CAUTION]
> 🏴‍☠️⚠️ While tested on Synology an' macOS, other waters may be stormier than expected.

Privateerr has been tested on Synology DS916+ running DSM 7.2, with Docker Compose version v2.9 as well as macOS Sequoia 15.3. But fear not, me hearties! It should work on other lands as well.
